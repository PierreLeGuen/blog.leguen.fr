# What I Disliked

* The most smug book I've ever read.
  * Wastes so many pages mocking financial authors and TV personalities.
* The author makes a specific point in the preface about how he eschewed the advice of editors and felt validated by the sales of his book, but I noticed many instances that could be improved with editing.
  * I felt like the book succeeded despite editing.
* The author puts far too much faith into Monte Carlo simulations
  * There are several instances where the author builds his own Monte Carlo simulation of the market, then concludes that a certain trading style is more profitable than another.
  * I am highly skeptical that anyone could get meaningful results by attempting to model the behavior of every market participant.
