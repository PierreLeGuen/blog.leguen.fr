The first time I heard about freelance work was in September 2018 at the Startup Weekend in Nantes, in La Cantine. During this weekend, I had the opportunity to meet some very talented people, including freelancers.

They praised me for freelance work, including remote work, well-paid missions, doing what you want when you want, and this adventure would allow me to acquire many skills...

As a student, it would be a very good experience for me. That's when I started asking myself a lot of questions:

- How to succeed as a freelancer and a student?
- What's the best structure for my freelance business?
- How to create this business?
- What kind of services shall I do?
- Where to find the first clients?
- And a lot more questions...

## How to succeed as a freelancer and a student?

I first tried to find some article on [medium](medium.com). I came across many of them, including one saying that "[You`ll Never Work as a Freelancer While You're a Student](https://medium.com/swlh/you-ll-never-work-as-a-freelancer-while-youre-a-student-b77d3a806ebd)". This made me realize the importance of personal branding and qualifications. But **challenge accepted**, and I will work as a freelancer while being a student.

Doing my engineering degree in Computer Science takes me approximately 40-45 hours per week, so this lets me 10-15 hours for freelancing every week.  

## What's the best structure for my freelance business?

There are many types of companies in France: *Entreprise Individuelle*, *Entreprise Individuelle à Responsabilité Limitée*, *Entreprise Unipersonnelle à Responsabilité Limitée*, *Société à Responsibilité Limitée*,*Société en Nom Collectif* ,*Société par Actions Simplifiée*, *Société par Actions Simplifiée Unipersonnelle*, and *Société Anonyme Par Actions* and others I've probably forgotten.

### How to choose between all of them?

It easier than it looks, I wont go deep in this but if you start a freelance business in France the best option is the Entreprise Individuelle (EI), the structure can be modified in the future. To accomplish this step I used a solution offered by [Shine](https://www.shine.fr/) which permits to create very easily the structure of the company.

[Shine](https://www.shine.fr/) is a French bank for entrepreneurs that purpose to help. The huge advantage of Shine it's that in future they will calculate all my taxes and will make administrative aspect of the business easier.

Thanks to that my business creation was signed the 12/12/2018. It's now time to think about what will I really do as a freelance.

## What kind of services shall I do?
